  ## Installation
  First, clone this repository. Next download and install Node.js if you do not have it already installed. Open the repository in VS Code, or whichever IDE you prefer to use. In your IDE open a new terminal and enter the following into the terminal: npm install inquirer. Note that the directory in the terminal needs to be the same as the location of the Professional README Generator folder. This concludes the installation. Once the installation is done you can start using the generator application by opening a new terminal window, type: node index, and press the Enter key.

  ## Usage
  Dynamically generates a professional README.md file by invoking the node index.js command and a userâ€™s input using the Inquirer package.

  ## Contribution
  Please pay me. ðŸ˜Š Just kidding (or am I!?)! You can contribute by sprucing this project up so the generated README.md file looks even nicer than it currently does.

  ## Testing
  Try breaking this application by inputting stuff that cannot be recognized. Any other form of stress test is recommended.
